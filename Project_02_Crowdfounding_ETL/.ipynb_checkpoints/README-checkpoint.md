Team Members:

In Project 2 we will doing analysis by ETL (Extract, Transform & Load) with the use of Python, Pandas and/or Regex.

The goal of the project is to analyze the data provided of a Crowdfunding Campaign, the information provided will be showing us details such as Company Name, Description, Goals, Contacts, Launch and End Dates and finally the Outcome of the campaign.

For the Analysis we have created multiple DataFrames:
    - Category / Subcategory
    - Campaign
    - Contacts
    - Crowdfunding

Throughout the process we will exporting DataFrames into .csv and .xlsx files to continue with the slice & dice of data wrangling.

The Category DataFrame is comprised by Food, Music, Technology, Theater, Film & Video, Publishing, Games, Photography and Journalism.

The next two DataFrames will show details about Contact ID, Company Name, Description, Goal, Pledged, Outcome, Backers Count, Country, Currency, Start and End Dates; and Contact details such as name, last name and email.

With this DataFrames the Crowdfunding Database is created and will provide results of the different campaigns.

Finally, we have created an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) with details of all related tables.	

This has been a great exercise to practice the different tools we have learned over the last three months.
